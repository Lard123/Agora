INTRODUCTION
------------
It's not cheap to attend FBLA Nationals. When your FBLA chapter qualifies to attend this prestigious competition, it comes with a hefty price, which includes the conference ticket, living accommodations, and food. Agora was built to mitigate this issue and enable FBLA chapters to minimize the amount of money needed to go to Nationals. Agora is a platform to help FBLA chapters fundraise money for Nationals through a digital yard sale. Users can easily add and bid on items through Agora's intuitive user interface.

Agora is an iOS app built ground-up with the Swift 3.0 programming language. Various open-source frameworks were used to create an immersive user interface and third-party SDKs (Software Development Kits), such as Firebase and Facebook, were used to expedite the app creation process. 

On the business side of Agora, we plan to license the app to chapters. The current version is specifically for Cupertino FBLA. However, we can sell the source code of the app to other chapters and they can edit the components of it for their own purposes.

An iOS device (iOS 8 or higher) or iOS emulator
•      The device must be able to take a picture or upload a picture file
•      This app is optimized for iOS capable devices (any screen size)
 

INSTALLATION
------------
•      This application is not available on the App Store
•      Must be run through Xcode via an iPhone Emulator or a connected device
 

CONFIGURATION
-------------
•      Configure user permissions in the Settings application on your device
•      Permissions
	•      Access to camera/camera roll
	•      Access to internet (Wi-Fi)
 

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
•      If the application takes an unnatural time to respond (over 5 seconds) it may be due to Wi-Fi connection
•      Files other than images may not be uploaded onto the application
 

SOFTWARE USED
-------------
Our integrated development environment (IDE) was Xcode, which accompanies the default Apple Simulator. To design the app and icon, we used Sketch due to its versatility. Additionally, we used Github as storage for both components of the code, as well as UI elements. The Swift 3.0 programming language was used to develop the app.


SOURCES OF INFORMATION
----------------------
To get acquainted with Apple's new programming language, Swift 3.0, we used a wide variety of resources. Udemy taught us how to effectively design iOS apps which are both powerful and immersive with the Swift programming language. Beyond Udemy, we used Stack Overflow's free public forums to aid us in errors we had. Extensive iOS development websites, such as Ray Wenderlich and Brian Advent's YouTube channel, were used when we needed to learn a new concept regarding iOS, such as playing a video in the background of a screen.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING PROJECT
--------------------------------
To run Agora on the Apple iOS Simulator:
Find and open the Xcode Project, denoted by the "Agora.xcodeproj". Simply click the the play button at the top left corner when Xcode opens the project. When you are prompted for a device to use, select any device to automatically run Agora on the Simulator.

To run Agora on a physical iPhone:
First download the Xcode file project. When opened, find and open the file Xcode Project. Simply click the the play button at the top left corner when Xcode opens the project. Attach any iOS capable device with iOS 8 or above. When you are prompted for a device to use select the device you have attached to automatically run Agora on your phone. Make sure that any prompts are accepted and the file is allowed to run. You may need to go to settings and make sure that the computer being used has permission to run application on the 
mobile device.


TEMPLATES USED
---------------
No templates were used in building the Agora app, just open-source frameworks to create a immersive and intuitive user interface.

For the website, we used a template designed by Peter Finlan (https://dribbble.com/peterfinlan) and made available through by w3layouts (https://w3layouts.com/)

RAISING AWARENESS OF AGORA
--------------------------
To increase publicity and awareness of our mission to minimize the cost to attend FBLA Nationals for Cupertino FBLA members, we realized that building a website and a Facebook page would be crucial. Our social media campaign has just begun, but we plan to increase the awareness of Agora through these two digital resources.
