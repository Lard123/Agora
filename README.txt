INTRODUCTION
------------
It’s not cheap to attend FBLA Nationals. When you’re school’s chapter qualifies to attend this prestigious competition, it comes with a hefty price, which includes the conference ticket, living accomodations, and food. Agora was built to mitigate this issue and enable FBLA chapters to minimize the amount of money needed to go to Nationals. Users can easily add and bid on items. 

Agora is an iOS app built with the Swift 3.0 programming language. F

FAQ
---
Q: Why canít I select photos from my gallery and upload it to my news feed?
A: PIC is an application meant to upload unaltered pictures for honest review by peers. PIC, in this manner, prevents users from portraying a false persona to their followers. 
   After all, uploading a picture that is altered no longer gives room to achieve the goals of PIC.
 
Q: Why canít I upload media other than pictures to my news feed?
A: The act of uploading media other than pictures is not in the intention of PIC or its developers. PIC is meant to be an application that allows FBLA members to share their opinions on 
   style, fashion, and attire. Users need not to upload media other than pictures to share their opinions and clothing choices, pictures are more than sufficient.

Q. What is the cloud at the top left of my screen?
A. One of the unique features of PIC is that it allows you to take the weather into account. Using the feature allows users to look their best in good weather, and be prepared in case of 
   a bad weather forcast.

Q. Why can I delete othersí comments and why can others delete my comments?
A. While the app design allows individuals to delete othersí comments, we felt that such a feature was necessary. Since PICís primary audience is FBLA members, and more specifically, high 
   school students, the possibility of cyber bullying arises. To prevent such abuse of PIC, we allow individuals to delete othersí comments. This way, people 
 
SOFTWARE USED
-------------
Our integrated development environment (IDE) was X-code, which accompanies the default Apple Simulator. To design high quality vector graphics, as well, as the original design for the app, Sketch was used. Additionally, we used Github as storage for both components of the code, as well as UI elements.

SOURCES OF INFORMATION
----------------------
Since we found promise in developing with Swift, the latest iOS programming language, and had not used the language extensively in the past, we needed to view some tutorials and access 
the internet for guidance. For assistance on the newly designed language, we referred to a tutorial made by Udemy. Udemy assisted us in setting up the workflow for the application, as 
well as certain differences in syntax. Beyond Udemy, we used Stack Overflow’s free public forums to aid us in errors we had. Extensive iOS development online websites, such as Ray Wenderlich and Brian Advent’s YouTube channel, were used when we needed to learn a new concept on iOS, such as playing a video in the background.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING PROJECT
--------------------------------
To run Agora on the Apple iOS Simulator:
Find and open the Xcode Project, denoted by the “Agora.xcodeproj”. Simply click the the play button at the top left corner when Xcode opens the project. When you are prompted for a device to use, select any device to automatically run Agora on the Simulator.

To run Agora on a physical iPhone:
First download the Xcode file project. When opened, find and open the file Xcode Project. Simply click the the play button at the top left corner when Xcode opens the project. Attach any iOS capable device with iOS 8 or above. When you are prompted for a device to use select the device you have attached to automatically run Agora on your phone. Make sure that any prompts are accepted and the file is allowed to run. You may need to go to settings and make sure that the computer being used has permission to run application on the 
mobile device.


TEMPLATES USED
---------------
No templates were used in building Agora, just open-source frameworks to create a immersive and intuitive user interface.
