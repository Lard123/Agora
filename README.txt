INTRODUCTION
------------
It's not cheap to attend FBLA Nationals. When your FBLA chapter qualifies to attend this prestigious competition, it comes with a hefty price, which includes the conference ticket, living accommodations, and food. Agora was built to mitigate this issue and enable FBLA chapters to minimize the amount of money needed to go to Nationals. Users can easily add and bid on items. 

Agora is an iOS app built ground-up with the Swift 3.0 programming language. Various open-source frameworks were used to create an immersive user interface and third-party SDKs (Software Development Kits), such as Firebase and Facebook, were used to expedite the app creation process.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
∑      An iOS device (iOS 8 or higher) or iOS emulator
∑      The device must be able to take a picture or upload a picture file
∑      This app is optimized for iOS capable devices (any screen size)
 
INSTALLATION

∑      Permissions
	∑      Access to camera/camera roll
	∑      Access to internet (Wi-Fi)
 
TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
∑      If the application takes an unnatural time to respond (over 5 seconds) it may be due to Wi-Fi connection
∑      Files other than images may not be uploaded onto the application
 

 
SOFTWARE USED
-------------
Our integrated development environment (IDE) was X-code, which accompanies the default Apple Simulator. To design high quality vector graphics, as well, as the original design for the app, Sketch was used. Additionally, we used Github as storage for both components of the code, as well as UI elements.

SOURCES OF INFORMATION
----------------------
Since we found promise in developing with Swift, the latest iOS programming language, and had not used the language extensively in the past, we needed to view some tutorials and access the internet for guidance. For assistance on the newly designed language, we referred to a tutorial made by Udemy. Udemy assisted us in setting up the workflow for the application, as well as certain differences in syntax. Beyond Udemy, we used Stack Overflow's free public forums to aid us in errors we had. Extensive iOS development online websites, such as Ray Wenderlich and Brian Advent's YouTube channel, were used when we needed to learn a new concept on iOS, such as playing a video in the background.

COPYRIGHT NOTATIONS
-------------------
The following open-source frameworks were used:
∑      Carthage (https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) was used for managing dependencies.
∑      SwiftGif (https://github.com/bahlo/SwiftGif) was used to play animated GIFs within the app.
∑      ImagePicker (https://github.com/hyperoslo/ImagePicker) was used to display an elegant camera in the app.
∑      TPKeyboardAvoiding (https://github.com/michaeltyson/TPKeyboardAvoiding) to make sure that the keyboard does not cover any information field.
∑      SwiftMessages (https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages) was used to display beautiful alerts.

The following SDKs (Sofware Development Kit) were used:

INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING PROJECT
--------------------------------
To run Agora on the Apple iOS Simulator:
Find and open the Xcode Project, denoted by the “Agora.xcodeproj”. Simply click the the play button at the top left corner when Xcode opens the project. When you are prompted for a device to use, select any device to automatically run Agora on the Simulator.

To run Agora on a physical iPhone:
First download the Xcode file project. When opened, find and open the file Xcode Project. Simply click the the play button at the top left corner when Xcode opens the project. Attach any iOS capable device with iOS 8 or above. When you are prompted for a device to use select the device you have attached to automatically run Agora on your phone. Make sure that any prompts are accepted and the file is allowed to run. You may need to go to settings and make sure that the computer being used has permission to run application on the 
mobile device.


TEMPLATES USED
---------------
No templates were used in building the Agora app, just open-source frameworks to create a immersive and intuitive user interface.

For the website, we used a template designed by Peter Finlan (https://dribbble.com/peterfinlan) and made available through by w3layouts (https://w3layouts.com/)
