INTRODUCTION
------------
It’s not cheap to attend FBLA Nationals. When you’re school’s chapter qualifies to attend this prestigious competition, it comes with a hefty price, which includes the conference ticket, living accommodations, and food. Agora was built to mitigate this issue and enable FBLA chapters to minimize the amount of money needed to go to Nationals. Users can easily add and bid on items. 

Agora is an iOS app built with the Swift 3.0 programming language. F

SOFTWARE USED
-------------
Our integrated development environment (IDE) was X-code, which accompanies the default Apple Simulator. To design high quality vector graphics, as well, as the original design for the app, Sketch was used. Additionally, we used Github as storage for both components of the code, as well as UI elements.

SOURCES OF INFORMATION
----------------------
Since we found promise in developing with Swift, the latest iOS programming language, and had not used the language extensively in the past, we needed to view some tutorials and access 
the internet for guidance. For assistance on the newly designed language, we referred to a tutorial made by Udemy. Udemy assisted us in setting up the workflow for the application, as 
well as certain differences in syntax. Beyond Udemy, we used Stack Overflow’s free public forums to aid us in errors we had. Extensive iOS development online websites, such as Ray Wenderlich and Brian Advent’s YouTube channel, were used when we needed to learn a new concept on iOS, such as playing a video in the background.

First download the Xcode file project. When opened, find and open the file Xcode Project. Simply click the the play button at the top left corner when Xcode opens the project. Attach any iOS capable device with iOS 8 or above. When you are prompted for a device to use select the device you have attached to automatically run Agora on your phone. Make sure that any prompts are accepted and the file is allowed to run. You may need to go to settings and make sure that the computer being used has permission to run application on the 
mobile device.

WEBSITE
-------
To increase publicity and awareness of our mission to minimize the cost to attend FBLA Nationals for Cupertino FBLA members, we realized that building a website and a Facebook page would be crucial.
